                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Colour Timelines is a website where you can select a video (or upload your own) and as the video plays, a timeline of the dominant colours throughout the video are "painted" on the page in three adjoining columns. When the video is done and the illustration is complete, it is then converted to an image that can be saved to your computer. Hosted on the front page is a sample of results from some of the videos I preloaded to my database, or again, you can upload your own.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's how it works. As the video plays, a frame from the video is drawn to a canvas object on a set interval (~4 seconds), the canvas is analysed for the 3 most dominant colours in that frame, and finally those 3 colours are drawn in a line after the last line of 3 colours from the previous frame. The result is that by the end of the video, you get a motif that is chronological from top-to-bottom, representing the colour palette of the video.</p>

                    <div class="column one-third">

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It was inspired by another art project on the web called The Colours of Motion, which took the dominant colour from frames of a film and created similar motifs. I loved the project, but I wanted to create a more interactive version, and utilize more colours per frame, as I often found there were at least two crucial colours that set the mood a given scene.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The primary resources that helped make this possible were two Javascript libraries, Colour Thief and html2canvas. Colour Thief takes an image as input and outputs the "n" most dominant colours, in my case "n" is three. html2canvas takes an html element and outputs it as an image. The final motif is simply a collection of coloured div objects grouped together, so this was necessary to save the result.</p>

                        <div class="numberhead">3</div>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing I wish I had been able to accomplish was allow the user to directly upload their image to the site upon completing a motif, but taking a base64 encoded image, converting to PNG, and uploading automatically without a form was something I didn't have time to figure out in the timeframe of this project. Regardless, I'm pleased with the where it's at and have already wasted a lot of time feeding it music videos and seeing what I get.</p>
