                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Transcoding Orbits was a project I completed for an assignment in a Tangible Media course. For this project, inspiration came from a (for me) surprising source: my Facebook feed. A friend of mine linked a short clip; a simplified visualization of the orbits of both Venus and Earth around the Sun, drawing lines between both planets throughout the cycle to draw a beautiful pattern that resembled a flower. The imagery reminded me very much of my last concept relating to the lotus and Buddhism, which is perhaps why the clip stuck in my mind. While the video demonstrated the relation of just two planets, obviously there are far more in our own solar system, thus potentially more cool patterns.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I subsequently came upon the idea to create a similar visualization, but I wanted all the paths to be drawn on the same map, giving the user control over which comparison to draw at any given moment. The result would hopefully be that one could observe the unique beauty of each pair's orbits, while also having the ability to switch between and overlap the patterns in any why they wanted, creating an abstract yet ornate pattern, constantly evolving (with a reset button for when they wanted a clean slate). </p>

                        <a target="_blank" href="images/planetmv.png">
                            <img class="pic" src="images/planetmv.png">
                        </a>

                    </div>

                    <div class="column one-third">
                        <div class="numberhead">2</div>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I chose to work with Processing for the visualization due to its similarities to Java, a language I was studying at that time, and thus was intuitive to work with. To properly represent the orbits, I found numbers online of the average distance each planet has from the Sun, as well as the time required for one full orbit. Using Mercury as the base (as it is the innermost planet), I programmed all the other planets to accurately demonstrate their average orbits, relative to the values I had chosen for Mercury.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;To control which orbit would be drawn, I used a simple potentiometer, setting each pair of planets to a different range of data coming from the serial port. The reason is twofold. Firstly, I found I liked the tactile nature of it, yielding greater accuracy, as well the fact it made the most sense for the design of my controller, which was made to resemble an astrolabe. An astrolabe was an ancient astronomy tool used to track the position of the stars in the sky, and it was used by rotating an alidade around the circular face, so it was thematically and mechanically exactly what I was looking for. The electronics were hooked up to a Arduino to communicate the data from the sensor into Processing to create the visuals.</p>

                        <div class="numberhead">3</div>
                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm fairly happy with the result, although everything could certainly use a little more polish were I to revisit it. Below are examples of each orbit, the controller, and an example of mixing the patterns together.</p>
