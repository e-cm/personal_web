                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Moving Mandala was done for my final project in a Tangible Media course. That semester, I had been taking a Buddhism course, and East Asian religious art was on my mind. Between my previous Transcoding Orbits project and Buddhist art, I found an interesting parallel, and that was the art of mandalas. The tracing of orbital patterns results in very mandala-like patterns. Mandalas are often described as circular diagrams composed of the repetition of multiple patterns and shapes meant to represent the cosmos and the universe. Mandalas, in the traditional sense, are circular diagrams used as a meditation tool, usually serving as a visual aid for focus and clarity, and in fact originate from early Buddhist and Hindu traditions.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I decided the means of interaction would be with a drum, as I had learned through a little research that percussion was a prominent feature in Buddhist and Hindu traditions. Much like the chanting that pervades Buddhist music, drums, chimes, and bells are often used to denote time, as well as the unity and inherent emptiness of all matter. Functionally, this project would be a fusion of two meditative instruments into one.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;For the mandala portion of the project, I worked with Processing for the visual output. The mandala sketch I ended up using was heavily inspired by the Sri Yantra mandala (example below), the most prominent mandala in Hinduism. Like essentially all religious mandalas, it is composed first and foremost by a square with four "gates" (protruding rectangles representing gates to the four sides of the universe) containing a circle (often interpreted as representing cycles: time, life and death). What characterizes the Sri Yantra mandala are the triangles contained within, orientated and overlapped to create a complex mathematical shape, meant to symbolize the overlapping of male and female creative energy. In the very center is a small point, called a bindu, which represents the center of creation and the cosmos, from which the mandala is produced.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Although not distinguishable in the final sketch, the rotating triangles, if stationary, compose the form of the Sri Yantra. I made them all semi-translucent and cycle through different colours, which aside from just generally being eye pleasing, I felt reinforced some of the ideas present in historical the historical Sri Yantra. By rotating the triangles, their orientation is lost, which was relevant in Sri Yantras for distinguishing between male and female creative energies. Likewise, the theme of cycles is present in the colour cycles the triangles go through while beating the drum.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The drum I used for the project was a tombak. While not thematically in line with the project, I was constrained by a studentâ€™s budget, and a classmate thankfully loaned this drum to me. In the early stages of trying to get the drum's resonance as an input, I attached a piezo contact microphone to the head of the drum and got the readings through the Arduino serial port. While it was technically working, it was hardly elegant or very sensitive; I found myself having to strike the drum quite hard to get any usable readings from it. Eventually I realized that it would probably be much cleaner and simpler to simply mic the drum and have the readings go directly into Processing. My final setup for the drum was simply my Bose earphones, which had a highly sensitive microphone on the wire, taped inside the drum, at the top of the throat leading into the head. It performed well, and since it's affixed inside the drum, the instrument still appears in it's intended elegant form, save the wire protruding from the bottom.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The actual interaction is about as simple as it gets: beat the drum and observe the changes in the mandala sketch. In its resting state, the center is murky, as the overlapping triangles lose definition in the depth of their colours, but when the drum is struck, the reverberations cause outlines to be drawn around the triangles, altering the speed of colour cycling, and simultaneously causing them to spike, all in such a way that is relative to the intensity of the strike. If struck hard enough, the spikes can escape the boundaries of the circle, and as such will remain even when the drum is left dormant and the strokes within the circle are overwritten.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, I was happy with the result, although limited experience with Processing at the time me frustrated when trying to implement certain tweaks I couldn't figure out in time. That said, The most important thing I try to accomplish in any creative work is to have it be compelling even when context is disregarded, which I think this does well. I don't think you have to know about any of the inspirations behind the aesthetic choices I made to have fun jamming out on the tombak just to see what kind of visuals you can create.</p>
