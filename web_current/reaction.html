                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many struggles that have shaped the city of Montreal. Re:action was a sound-based final project for a web-based course that I worked on with two of my classmates Jeremy Segal and Celeste Pimm. Re:action aimed to recharge physical spaces with the ambient riotous energy that existed there in the past.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;We chose specific locations that had been sites of riots and protests. By politicizing geographical locations with digital sound environments, our project encourages its users to engage with physical and virtual spaces as settings for political discourse while informing them of the location's history in a visceral way.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Re:action was framed around the apathetic attitude generated by internet culture, where showing support for a cause on social media is considered an adequate political action. The project consisted of a web component and several related real-world components. The primary experience is enabled by QR codes that were placed at the chosen sites of riots and protests. Scanning the QR codes will link to the website and play the soundscape created for that specific location; while providing information that contextualizes the experience.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In relation to the continuing conversation about interactivity, our project is of interest because it brings interactivity into the real world. We've seen examples of online interactive worlds that are used for escapism, and manifestos declaring the virtual space as a whole new world. There has been a shift away from recreating life in the virtual space and our project contributes to that movement. Whereas before the aim was to use technology to reimagine the world in a virtual space, we aimed to reimagine space in the real world through a new lens afforded to us by the internet.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;My two teammates handled the creation of the sound pieces themselves and wrote the information accessed at each location. I developed the website itself, and designed the posters that were placed at our selected locations.</p>

                        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This was the first group project I completed in Computation Arts at Concordia, and my first real artistic collaboration, and it helped me realize how rewarding it was to hash out ideas with other creative thinkers and make something bigger than ourselves.</p>
