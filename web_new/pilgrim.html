					<p>Pilgrimage (For The Internet) was a project done by Nicole Lin and myself for a Networks and Navigation class. It's a website that guides the user on a geolocated journey to several sites around Montreal that serve as symbolic "holy sites" of the Internet. The idea was to mirror the idea of the pilgrimage, common to many world religions, except in this instance, the god we are going on this journey for is the Internet. Pilgrimages are often undertaken to visit sites of importance to the religion, such as the birth place of an important figure or the location of their first sermon. Pilgrimage (For The Internet) also takes you sites of birth and sermons, but those things are far different when the subject is not a physical being.</p>

                	<p>This project was born from two central concepts. Firstly, the Internet as God. As technology and the Internet have progressed, the importance of faith in the everyday lives of citizens continually engaged by the internet has dwindled. Many argue a key component of faith is devotion, and there's no doubt a significant portion of the population devotes a significant portion of their time to the Internet. It has become so central to our lives that it's difficult to imagine how we could even function anymore if it were to suddenly disappear. The narrative style of Pilgrimage (For The Internet) imagines what the preacher at the Church of the Internet would sound like as he guides you on your pilgrimage.</p>

                	<p>The second concept is that of psychogeography, coined by Guy Debord. Psychogeography is roughly the idea of wandering playfully to break out of the daily travel cycles many of us in big cities find ourselves in. We may live in sprawling metropolises, but the commitments of our day-to-day often tow us down the same streets, buses, and metro lines, resulting in us experiencing our environments with blinders on. We loved the idea of a pilgrimage serving as a conduit for playful wandering, by assigning the user destinations but not directions, importantly destinations that the average person has probably never had any reason to visit before.</p>

                	<p>The backbone of the project is the Google Maps API, which had all the functionality we needed to execute this project, namely the ability to track the user's location in comparison to the destinations, and displaying messages and further instructions when they were in the vicinity of their current objective. Additionally, PHP is used for a guest book at each location, allowing users to leave messages that future visitors can read, conveying the idea of leaving wisdom and a piece of yourself as you progress through your journey. Lastly, Javascript is used to manage all the pop-ups and interaction.</p>

                	<p>Nicole was in charge of implementing the Maps API and making the documentation video, and I handled writing, graphic design, web design, and PHP. Visually, I wanted a digital/retro vibe when it came to text combined with stained-glass influenced icons depicting subjects integral to the internet</p>

                	<p>Featured here are some screenshots of the site in use and the icons I created for the project. While intended to be used on mobile in the downtown Montreal area, we added a "demo" button which moves the user's position around the locations featured to demonstrate what one could expect if this project were to be fully realized.</p>
